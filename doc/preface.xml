    <title>Trading in the ESCape key</title>
    <para>
      In the beginning, terminals had ESCape keys. (Go back far
      enough and the device TT: stands for might actually have
      existed on the system, too...) Programs wanting to treat
      &lt;CR&gt; &amp; Co. as data needed another character to
      serve as command
      <indexterm>
        <primary>Delimiter</primary>
        <secondary>command string</secondary>
      <indexterm>
      delimiter, and ESCape looked available.
    </para>
    <para>
      Times change. Welcome to ESCape sequences, to
      cursor-control and function keys. Farewell to $$.
      Hello ''.

    <title>Change to the manual</title>
    <para>
      This edition of the manual incorporates new material
      pertinent to the enhancements to TECO-11 between
      Version 36 and Version 40 (see below).
    </para>
    <para>
      Although this manual is still not intended to be a tutorial,
      some "how to learn" suggestions (such as use of split-screen
      scrolling) were added, as were indications of how TECO can
      be used to build custom-designed editors.
    </para>
    <para>
      Numerous smaller changes were also made: clarifications,
      new index and glossary entries, additional explanatory
      material and cross referrals, correction of old typographic
      errors, and (no doubt) addition of new ones.

    <title>TECO-32 Goes Native</title>
    <para>
      TECO for VAX/VMS started life as a <newterm>(hybrid) image. The command
      processor and editor proper were the same as TECO-11 and ran in PDP-11 
      compatibility mode on VAX processors. The operating system interface and
      file service logic ran in VAX native mode.
    </para>
    <para>
      With the advent of new processors without microcode support for PDP-11
      compatibility mode, TECO could only be run on such processors when VAX RSX,
      which supplies PDP-11 instruction emulation, was present. This resulted in
      a dramatic decrease in performance.
    </para>
    <para>
      Included with VMS version 5.0 is TECO-32, a brute force translation of
      TECO-11 to VAX native mode performed by Richard H. Murphy of Digital
      Equipment Corporation. It was included into VMS V5.0 by Andrew C. Goldstein,
      also of Digital.
    </para>
    <para>
      This version of the manual is a brute force translation from the May 1985.
      edition into  Standard Document Markup Language (SDML) done by Rien Timmer,
      Digital. Enhancements to the manual were made to include TECO-32.
    </para>
    <para>
      Added and changed features of TECO-32 are described in <reference>(app_vms).
