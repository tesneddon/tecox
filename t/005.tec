! TECO-32 does not like this next bit of code and as such !
! results in a UTC and execution terminates.  However,    !
! according to the Standard TECO manual, the correct      !
! behaviour is to proceed to the next ' and continue      !
! execution there.                                        !
! So...bug fixed? ~\_("/)_/~                              !
