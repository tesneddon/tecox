You are sitting in your little mud hut in Piing Poong eating your bowl
of rice when all of a sudden a typhoon blows in.  The resulting flood
washes you out of your hut and into *TA DA (ominous music, etc. etc.)*
 
                    ***The Sewers of Piing Poong***
 
 
Your mission, should you decide to accept it (and I certainly hope you
do. The sewers are not the nicest place to live), is to escape from the
sewers and return to your little mud hut and wait for the next typhoon.
 
Commands are;

	MOVE <direction>  (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN)
	TAKE <thing>
	DROP <thing>
	LOOK
	INVENTORY
	OPEN

Everything can be abbreviated to one letter,  so "M E" is the same
as "MOVE EAST".
